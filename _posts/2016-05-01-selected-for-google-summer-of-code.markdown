I am selected for Google Summer of Code 2016 under fedora project. My project name is "Tinykdump‚Äù, an improved tool to replace kdump". I will be working on it full time for next 4 months. This project is a twofold task. First part is to create a linux kernel patch which will allocate memory for kexec (crash dump capture) kernel. Then I will develop a minimalistic tool which will be simpler and reliable than current fedora's kdump tool.
